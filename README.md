I am Pengyu Cheng, a researcher in machine learning and NLP.
- Currently, I am devoting my passion to applying cutting-edge NLP techniques to game scenarios, especially for Metaverse construction! 
- My NLP research interests focus on controllable text generation and interpretable natural language understanding. 
- I also have a broad interest in probabilistic machine learning methods.
- I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electric and Computer Engineering at Duke University in 2021.
- I graduated with my B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tsinghua University in 2017.

We are hiring NLP researchers and interns globally! If you are curious or enthusiastic about applying deep learning into the virtual gaming world, contact me at `pengyucheng@tencent.com`.

I am Pengyu Cheng, a researcher and passionate in machine learning and NLP.
- I am a senior researcher at Tencent Interactive Entertainment Group.
- Currently, I am devoting my passion to applying NLP techniques into **game** scenarios, especially for **Metaverse**! 
- My NLP research interests focus on **text generation**, **dialogue system**, and **interpretable** language understanding. 
- I also have broad interests in probabilistic machine learning methods.
- I received my Ph.D. degree from [Duke University](https://ece.duke.edu/) in 2021, advised by Dr. [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/).
- I graduated with my B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at [Tsinghua University](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2017.

We are **hiring** NLP researchers and interns globally! If you are curious or enthusiastic about applying deep learning into the virtual gaming world, contact me at `pengyucheng@tencent.com`.
